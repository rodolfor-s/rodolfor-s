After some time of hard work I'm happy to share my next preprint (in years!).  
Hopeful to start making this happen more often now. Here it is: [Multipartite quantum correlations in a two-mode Dicke model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09260).  
This study has been done in partnership with my supervisor in Brazil, Gabriel Landi, and our colleague Mark Mitchison at Trinity College Dublin.
