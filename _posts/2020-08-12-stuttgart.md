I am happy to share that I will be spending some time in the University of Stuttgart as part of my PhD project.

I will work with the group of Nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and Prof. Eric Lutz.

That will be part of a joint PhD programme in partnership between the group of Prof. Gabriel Landi at USP and Stuttgart, financed by the DAAD and CNPq.
