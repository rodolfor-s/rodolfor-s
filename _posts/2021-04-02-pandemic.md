I would just like to give an update to the readers that this website is still very much alive!

I haven't posted much, but as you can imagine this is due to the current pandemic situation and the lack of activities undergoing, in general.

As the reader can imagine, I am continuing the pursuit of my PhD, and I currently work at the University of Stuttgart, and also at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, remotely.

Hopefully we will have a more lively environment soon, and then I'll post more interesting stuff.
